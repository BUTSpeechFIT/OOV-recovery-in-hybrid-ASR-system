# OOV-recovery-in-hybrid-ASR-system
Out-of-vocabulary word recovery system makes use of a hybrid decoding network with both words and sub-word units.  In the decoded lattices, candidates for OOV regions are identified as sub-graphs of sub-word units. To facilitate OOV word recovery, we search for recurring OOVs by clustering the detected candidate OOVs.
